This repo was cloned from the [splid-devkit repository](https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/splid-devkit). It is the repository used in the submission of the 
'MiseryModel' in the AI SSA Challenge.

# BRANCH CURRENTLY WIP

# Content
- [**own_model**](./own_model): This directory contains all relevant submission files. See directory for more information.
- [**dataset**](./dataset): Contains datasets. Currently uploaded are phase 1 version 2 and 3, as well as the phase 2
dataset.
- [**environment.yml**](./environment.yml): This is the anaconda environment file extracted from the environment used 
for this submission.
- [**requirements.txt**](./requirements.txt): This file is the pip version of the environment.yml.
file.
- [**train.py**](./train.py): Execute this file and passing it a train (and test) dataset to train all models. 

# Reproducibility
## [WIP]
Please see the main branch for reproducibility as this branch is still WIP. The idea is to just execute the 
[**train.py**](./train.py) file and passing it a train dataset (and possible test dataset). Then, all models are trained
and evaluated. While it already works, the classification model training is broke and needs fixing.
